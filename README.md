Light-league: a new unit of length
==================================

Miles?

Kilometers?

What about a new unit of length instead?

* * *

A light-league is the distance travelled by light in one ten-billionth of a day.

    1 ll = 10^-10 d

* * *

It is close to the ancient celtic league.

    1 ll = 2.59020683712 km

* * *

A light-league is to a mile what a mile is to a kilometer.

    1 ll ≈ 1.609 mi
    1 mi ≈ 1.609 km

It's a pretty cool unit.
